It looks like the majority of the books in the Goodreads database were written in the late 20th and early 21st century.
Now we can ask if Goodreads reviewers have a preference for more recent literature.
First, let's check if older authors (by first published book date) appear to have lower (or higher) ratings than newer authors:

Next, let's look to see if more prolific authors (those with more books published total) tend to have higher ratings:
